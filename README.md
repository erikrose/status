2013-08-06
----------

* Reviewed [MXR malware-hosting](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=628033>) fix. Fubar is merging and deploying it.
* Ran the WebDev Extravaganza.
    * peep makes your downloads trustworthy,
        * so we can use PyPI (and its new CDN, which makes it reasonably reliable).
        * You don't have to trust authors.
        * So it's like a "pip freeze" with teeth.
* Chased [spurious DXR build publishing](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=886463) that happened despite a build failure.
* Invited non-employees to WebDev Extravaganza.

2013-08-05

* Sent out invite to WebDev Extravaganza. Put pyelasticsearch 0.6 release, django-nose co-maintainer solicitation, and discussion of the future of crypto-verified repeatable Python deployments on the agenda.
* First round of simplified DXR UI refresh wireframes
